# Benefits of switching teams

## Intro

In my career, I've been lucky enough to work in a number of companies in significant range of roles and responsibilities.  Even within same companies, I've moved (and been moved) around different products.  As of 2018, I have worked on 12 different products (averaging about 1 a year).  The positives of these moves are many with a few of them listed below.

## Benefits

### New challenges

I believe that it's important in our industry to keep your skills fresh and diverse.  You never know when the product you're an expert in (e.g. Silverlight, Flex, Flash) will go away/stops being supported.  Moving around and being exposed to different tools and technologies also makes you more employable.  I'll write a follow-up blog post detailing how I go through learning a new technology/stack/-ility.  Finally, and most importantly for me, these challenges allowed me to not get stale and bored doing the same thing.  While there are people who are better at honing their craft in one place, I've found myself most engaged and most productive when I switch products, platforms, or even technologies every so often.

### Knowledge sharing

Ability to share expertise between teams/companies is the #1 reason that consulting/contracting is so successful.  It's very enticing for companies to pay a premium for knowledge that a temporary worker can share with their permanent workforce.  Not only would their workforce have access to current industry standards but also relevant experience in implementing new stack/technology without the extra cost of paying for formal training.  Similar benefits can happen when moving team members within the company with the added benefit of product-specific knowledge, which is especially beneficial if the new team utilizes the previous team's product.  Case in point, at my current company, every team I've moved onto used the my first team's product as a reverse proxy.  My knowledge in configuring and troubleshooting this product allowed me to quickly provide value as well as provided the new team with experience and piece of mind regarding what they had previously considered to be a black box.

Knowledge sharing, however, goes both ways.  If the transition to the new team is temporary (a la consultant), you can easily pick up the best practices from your adopted team and bring it back once your rotation is over.  Every team I've been on did at least one thing better than the rest, whether it be test automation, development maturity, CI/CD practices, prototyping, infrastructure automation, or just general processes.  Every team I've been on, I've picked up something to share with either my previous teams or my future teams.

### Teamwork across the company

One of the most important benefits of switching between teams is creating new teams and giving teammates insights into multiple products within the same company.  If you do the same thing for years, you may lose appreciation of what it's like to work on a different product or in a different department.  You might think that every product is run like yours, which is certainly not true.  You might also become jaded when another team doesn't deliver as quickly as your team does.  The best way to fight that feeling is to join another team and be privy to their processes, development maturity and other areas.  You might quickly found out the reasons for the product maturity being different than your previous team's, including, but not limited to:

* **development team seniority**: the team might be mainly junior developers who need guidance.

* **business processes**: the business process do not allow the team to release early and often due to a large number of internal and external dependencies/compliances they have to go through prior to releasing to production.

* **tech debt**: quite frankly, the team may have inherited broken software that they're trying to fix while releasing features.

* **optimization opportunities**: finally, the team might not be aware of how they can improve and your experience might get them on their way.  It would be a win for them in improving their product as well as for you in helping them get there and learning some tips and tricks along the way.

This has become a long post as-is, but there's the other side of switching teams often.  I will tackle the drawbacks in the next post.
