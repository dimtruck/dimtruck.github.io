# Drawbacks of switching teams

## Intro

In the [previous post](https://dimtruck.github.io/2018-01-28/benefits-of-switching-teams), I covered some of the benefits of frequently switching teams inside a company.  While I stand by the assertion that these benefits outweigh any drawbacks of this approach, it would be disingenuous for me to deny that the consistent migration between teams has its challenges.  Just as with benefits, there are other drawbacks to constant moving around; however, I've highlighted a few that gave me the most heartache in my career.

## Drawbacks

### Building trust within the new team

One of the main drawbacks of constant movement is that every time you join a new team, you need to build trust of your new team in your skills.  That's easier said than done since you have a limited time to do this and, therefore, you have to build this trust quicker than if you were on a multi-year plan.  You need to quickly bring yourself up to speed on the product, its main technical needs as well as its strengths, team processes, etc.  It's important to listen and absorb without critiquing any of the current codebase/SDLC processes, even if they seem archaic.  The team you're joining has a historical knowledge of how things came to be and the struggles they went through; therefore, the _worst_ thing you can do as a new team member is to say: "this is silly; we should change it."  That not only will create friction between you and the team but also delay the trust-building process.

That being said, after you've absorbed enough information, learned the product and proved (either by relieving a tech debt, successfully delivering a feature in the sprint, or adding a small footprint that improves the team's life), and you feel more comfortable around team members, _then_ it's time to suggest large changes.

How do you know when it's time?  For me, it's usually when team members come and say something like:

* Wouldn't it be cool if we didn't have to do X
* We should stop doing Y
* Z is really frustrating for me

Listen for those key phrases because it means that once you're comfortable, _those_ are the areas to attack/improve.  It's doubly helpful if the observations you've made the first few weeks align with the team's frustrations since improving their key concerns improves their trust level in you the most.

### Understand the ins and outs of the product

My main struggle and at the same time the thing I look forward to the most is learning how a new product works.  I like to look at a product first as a black box, pick at its peripherals, and then jump into the code and understand how each flow happens and where are its warts.  The challenge is that with limited time it's _really hard_ to truly understand the ins and outs of a complex system.  In the next post, I'll put together ideas on how to tackle this; however, for folks who want to become subject matter experts in one thing, consistent moving around is really challenging.  At the end, you become sort of a Jack of all trades, master of none.  In short, you become a generalist at your company.  While it's great for those who want to know a little bit about every system, it's stressful for others who want to have depth and really understand the system for which they're responsible.

### Building commitment/ownership of the product

Heavily related to the first two points is that wholesome feeling of owning something and knowing that _you_ are responsible for a piece of software.  You end up treating it almost like a child, listening to your system's every heartbeat, noticing before others when it's sick and being the go-to person to make it better.  You can almost say goodbye to that feeling when you frequently move around.  One of the biggest challenges with consulting is that you never see your baby grow up.  You always leave for the next thing while the system that you've spent months architecting and building matures into a key piece of business without you.  Even worse is if you come back years later and the software you helped build changed so much that you don't even recognize it.  You can still find your commits sprinkled here and there; but the core so completely changed that you feel like you missed out.

Laugh as you might, these are real feelings developers go through.  Those that cannot handle letting go, will most certainly struggle moving frequently from team to team.  You're no longer an owner but just a mercenary, and you have to come to terms with that.

## Summary

In the last two posts we've outlined PROs and CONs of moving between teams.  In this post, specifically, we've touched on some of the steps you can take to make your onboarding easier; however, in the next post, I'll outline an exact roadmap I like to follow to optimize my time on a team so that when it's time to roll off, the team doesn't feel like my time on it was a waste and I feel like I really contributed to the product with both best practices and learned lessons taken to the next chapter of my career.
